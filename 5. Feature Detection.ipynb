    "_In computer vision and image processing the concept of feature detection refers to methods that aim at computing abstractions of image information and making local decisions at every image point whether there is an image feature of a given type at that point or not. The resulting features will be subsets of the image domain, often in the form of isolated points, continuous curves or connected regions._\n",
    "Feature detection can include detecting edges, some defined patches in the images, center or the corners of the image. Of these while Image Processing, the patches are flat and are difficut to track. As we move verticalling while processing then edges would change, from bottom edge to a left (or right upward edge). Hence these would be difficult to extract. Whereas while processing corners each patch of the corner to be processed would be different from eaach other and hence it would be easier to track. Blobs are another type of features which prove effective for extraction. "

    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "In last couple of chapters, we saw some corner detectors like Harris, Shi Tomasi etc. They are rotation-invariant, which means, even if the image is rotated, we can find the same corners. It is obvious because corners remain corners in rotated image also. But what about scaling? A corner may not be a corner if the image is scaled. A corner in a small image within a small window is flat when it is zoomed in the same window. So Harris corner is not scale invariant.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are mainly four steps involved in SIFT algorithm:\n",
    "1. Scale-space Extrema Detection: \n",
    "Due to scale-variance we can't use the same window to detect keypoints with different scale. It is OK with small corner. But to detect larger corners we need larger windows. For this, scale-space filtering is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Keypoint Localization:\n",
    "Once potential keypoints locations are found, they have to be refined to get more accurate results. They used Taylor series expansion of scale space to get more accurate location of extrema, and if the intensity at this extrema is less than a threshold value (0.03 generally), it is rejected. This threshold is called contrastThreshold in OpenCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Orientation Assignment:\n",
    "Now an orientation is assigned to each keypoint to achieve invariance to image rotation. A neigbourhood is taken around the keypoint location depending on the scale, and the gradient magnitude and direction is calculated in that region\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Keypoint Descriptor\n",
    "Now keypoint descriptor is created. A 16x16 neighbourhood around the keypoint is taken. It is devided into 16 sub-blocks of 4x4 size. For each sub-block, 8 bin orientation histogram is created. So a total of 128 bin values are available. It is represented as a vector to form keypoint descriptor. In addition to this, several measures are taken to achieve robustness against illumination changes, rotation etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Keypoint Matching\n",
    "Keypoints between two images are matched by identifying their nearest neighbours. But in some cases, the second closest-match may be very near to the first. It may happen due to noise or some other reasons. In that case, ratio of closest-distance to second-closest distance is taken. If it is greater than 0.8, they are rejected. It eliminaters around 90% of false matches while discards only 5% correct matches.\n",
