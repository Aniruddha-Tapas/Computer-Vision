    "___\n",
    "Normally, we used to work with an image of constant size. But in some occassions, we need to work with images of different resolution of the same image. For example, while searching for something in an image, like face, we are not sure at what size the object will be present in the image. In that case, we will need to create a set of images with different resolution and search for object in all the images. These set of images with different resolution are called Image Pyramids (because when they are kept in a stack with biggest image at bottom and smallest image at top look like a pyramid). Basically an “image pyramid” is a multi-scale representation of an image.\n",
