Using more iterations will allow CamShift to (ideally) find a closer centroid match between the selected ROI and the tracked ROI; however, this comes at the cost of runtime.

    "## Optical Flow\n",
    "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow\">Optical flow</a> is the pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames caused by the movemement of object or camera. It is 2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from first frame to second. \n",
    "\n",
    "Optical flow has many applications in areas like :\n",
    "* Structure from Motion\n",
    "* Video Compression\n",
    "* Video Stabilization ...\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lucas-Kanade method is one of the methods used to solve the problem of finding optical flow in video frames. The gist of the method is that we give some points to track, we receive the optical flow vectors of those points. For large motion videos we have to use pyramids. As we go up in the pyramid, small motions are removed and large motions becomes small motions. So applying Lucas-Kanade there, we get optical flow along with the scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OpenCV <a href= \"http://docs.opencv.org/3.0.0/dc/d6b/group__video__track.html#ga473e4b886d0bcc6b65831eb88ed93323\">cv2.calcOpticalFlowPyrLK()</a> is used for this purpose. The following code is used to tracks some points in a video. To decide the points, we use <a href=\"http://docs.opencv.org/3.0.0/dd/d1a/group__imgproc__feature.html#ga1d6bb77486c8f92d79c8793ad995d541\">cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack()</a>. We take the first frame, detect some Shi-Tomasi corner points in it, then we iteratively track those points using Lucas-Kanade optical flow. For the function _cv2.calcOpticalFlowPyrLK()_ we pass the previous frame, previous points and next frame. It returns next points along with some status numbers which has a value of 1 if next point is found, else zero. We iteratively pass these next points as previous points in next step."
