    "OpenCV has a built-in pre-trained HOG + Linear SVM model that can be used to perform human detection in both images and video streams. We implement the non-maxima suppression (NMS) algorithm which in short takes multiple, overlapping bounding boxes and reduces them to only a single bounding box; so as to reduce the number of false-positives reported by the final object detector. The following code performs the task of pedestrian detection:"

    "First after importing the required modules and loading our folder that contains the pedestrian images, we initialize our pedestrian detector. We make a call to _hog = cv2.HOGDescriptor()_  which initializes the Histogram of Oriented Gradients descriptor. Then, we call the _setSVMDetector_  to set the Support Vector Machine to be pre-trained pedestrian detector, loaded via the cv2.HOGDescriptor_getDefaultPeopleDetector()  function.\n",

    "\n",
    "From there, we handle loading our image off disk and resizing it to have a maximum width of 400 pixels. We reduce our image dimensions because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reducing image size ensures that less sliding windows in the image pyramid need to be evaluated (i.e., have HOG features extracted from and then passed on to the Linear SVM), thus reducing detection time (and increasing overall detection throughput).\n",
    "2. Resizing our image also improves the overall accuracy of our pedestrian detection (i.e., less false-positives).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the detectMultiScale method of the HOG descriptor that constructs an image pyramid with scale=1.05 and a sliding window step size of (4, 4)  pixels in both the x and y direction respectively. The size of the sliding window is fixed at 32 x 128 pixels. The detectMultiScale  function returns a 2-tuple of rects , or the bounding box (x, y)-coordinates of each person in the image, and weights , the confidence value returned by the SVM for each detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "A larger scale  size will evaluate less layers in the image pyramid which can make the algorithm faster to run. However, having too large of a scale (i.e., less layers in the image pyramid) can lead to pedestrians not being detected. Similarly, having too small of a scale  size dramatically increases the number of image pyramid layers that need to be evaluated. Not only can this be computationally expecnsive, it can also increase the number of false-positives detected by the pedestrian detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we take our initial bounding boxes and draw them on our image. However, for some images you’ll notice that there are multiple, overlapping bounding boxes detected for each person. In this case, we have two options. We can detect if one bounding box is fully contained within another. Or we can apply non-maxima suppression and suppress bounding boxes that overlap with a significant threshold.\n",
